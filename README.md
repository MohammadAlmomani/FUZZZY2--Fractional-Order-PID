fractional-order fuzzy proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is a controller that
combines the benefits of fractional calculus and fuzzy logic with the conventional PID controller. In this
paper, a four-stage optimization algorithm is proposed for the design of a Type-2 Fuzzy fractional-order PID
controller based on the Fourier Series Method (FSM). Three distinct control structures are introduced: Type-2
fuzzy fractional PD + fractional PI controller, Type-2 fuzzy fractional PID, and Type-2 fuzzy fractional
PD + Type-2 fuzzy fractional PI controller. In addition to a modified multi-performance criterion cost
function, four integral performance criteria are employed as cost functions for each stage. The suggested
algorithm avoids the utilization of the approximation equivalent for the fractional-order system and instead
employs FSM. Furthermore, the approach optimizes the nonlinearity within the upper membership function
(UMF) and the uncertainty range through the lower membership function, as opposed to arbitrary selection.
By considering variations in the membership functions, the outcomes exhibit a superior response compared
to previous investigations. The results of the three control structures are compared with the traditional PID
controller, and simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of this technique. The findings suggest that by
optimizing different integral performance criteria using this design technique, controllers for both integer and
fractional-order plants can yield favorable step responses. The proposed algorithm is validated by comparing
its step response performance with that of previous research, followed by a discussion on sensitivity analysis
and computational requirements.
